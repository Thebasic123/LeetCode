1.check whether postfix expression is valid 

A postfix expression is valid if and only if:

1) The first two elements are operands(values), and

2) The last element is an operator, and

3) For every n values there are n-1 operator(s), and

4) In a list of n elements, starting at index i = 0 for i < n-1 (the second to last element), every group of elements consisting of k values( for k > 1 ) is followed by (k-1) operators. When k = 1, the number of operators that follows = k = 1.


Initialize the counter to 0.
When you see a literal, increment the counter.
When you see a binary operator, decrement the counter twice, then increment it.
When you see a unary operator, decrement the counter, then increment it.
At the end of the string, if the counter is 1, and if it never went below 0, the string is valid.
